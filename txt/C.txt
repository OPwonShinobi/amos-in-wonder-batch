 Amos, immediately for some reason, starts to dissolve from his stomach after he drinks the water. In a morbid display of biology, Louie witnesses Amos turning from a solid organism, to a fleshy mass of aqueous organs. 

"Hey, why did I stop dissolving, I look disgusting in this midway state."

"It's because you've reached equilibrium. You're forming products and reactants at the same rate. Here is your formula:
	Amos (s) + H2O(l) -> Amos (aq)

Keq is the a constant that equals the concentration of the reaction products over reactants in an equilibrium. For this reaction:
	Keq = [Amos(aq)]/[Amos(s)][H2O(l)]

However, solids and liquids always have a concentration of 1, which you can omit. So the reaction becomes:
	Keq = [Amos(aq)]

Enter S if Louie decides to add more H2O to amos
Enter D if Louie decides to dry Amos up
