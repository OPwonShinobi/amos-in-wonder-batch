For once in his life, the little angel on Amos' shoulder speaks up from its eternal slumber.
"ZZZ...Stop listening to the devil... on your other shoulder, do the right thingâ€¦.for once ZZZ..."
With his guilt virginity newly gone, Amos declares that his win is a fluke, and that he isn't Ghost Boy at all; he is only Amos the Ghost. The crowd goes wild again, but this time throwing things at Amos.

Amos closes his eyes as a Hebden book flies toward his face. 

When he reopens his eyes, he is in the emergency room of a hospital.
"Oh good you're awake," said Alex the Nurse.
"Why are you the nurse, and why am I here?" Amos asked.
"Your friend Louie dragged you here because you were puking foam," he answered.
"Can you tell my teacher Mr. Irani that I am sick and cannot do the exam?"
"You're talking to Irani right now, and you look healthy enough to stay for a little test. I came as soon as I gave all my other students their exams. It's not fair that you skip while your classmates suffer, you get what I'm saying?"
Amos faints again.
"No no no, don't do that again. Here, hospital beds come with a table to eating, and conveniently for us, doing chem exams. The faster you set up, the more time you have to do the test."
Clinging onto shreds of hope that he can still perhaps persuade Mr. Irani, Amos weeped and begged once more, "For wonderland's and my adventure's sake, please let me do the test at a later date, please excuse this morning's leave, or here lies Amos Li...  
".....Onyourmarksgetsetstart."
