With all his literary bs he learned from English class, Amos fabricates a somewhat convincing story. Surprisingly, the Red Queen believes it and takes sympathy and decides to help him.
"I'll see what I can do for you little poor thing," the Red Queen pities as he pulls out his fabulous notebook of fabulous science.
Using titration methods, the Red Queen finds out Amos' chemical identity.
"Amos, sweetie, you are absolutely not chemically fabulous. You're an alloy of mess, and some iron, but mostly mess. I will make you all fabulous."
Crude Amos(s) + NaClO(aq) => Pure Amos(s) + Impurities in Amos(ppt)
The Red Queen scanned Amos under a fabuscope and he saw something strange taking place.
"The electrons have rearranged themselves in different orbitals. We call this hybridization, when electrons from one suborbital jump into another to make room for those from another atom. By combining and sharing electrons, this is how covalent bonds form."
Amos is grateful to the Red Queen and he decides to work as his guard for eternity.
As a result, Amos lives happily ever after in Wonderland since he never needed to do the AP chemistry exam.
