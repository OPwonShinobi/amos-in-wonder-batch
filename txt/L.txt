 With a spear pointed at his butthole, Alex the Guard pushes Amos into a dark room at the base of the castle. 
"Welcome to the ‘Rabbit Hole of Wonderland', aka the Red Queen's Torture Chamber."
"Why is it called that?" Amos asked nervously.
"This is the ‘wonder'land that puts Wonderland to shame, as in, Wonderland feels ashamed of it..."

Looking around, the dungeon is incredibly well kept. Shelves line the walls, filled with mementos from past science projects. 
Inside, Amos is greeted by a transvestite dressed in royal undergarment. 
"I don't think we've ever properly met.  I am the Red Queen. I know you are Amos, a naughty little boy whom your friend Louie has told me too much about."
"Oh boy, I love where this is going…."
"Me too, now let's have some fun."

Enter Q if the Red Queen wants to play with electricity
