Amos manages to break the photon pack. In a fantastic explosion that also knocked Alex out for an indeterminate amount of time, Amos rapidly spread out in all directions.
After Amos reassembles his gassy body with the force of sheer will, he realizes that Alex has brought him somewhere alien. 
"WHAT THE HELL!" remarks an Indian-looking red queen in drag, with greying whiskers and sideburns. 
Amos asks out of innocent curiosity, "Which one are you supposed to be? A king or a queen? I wanna see, is it sausage or is it taco?" 
"NAY NAY!" barks the unisex monarch, "the existence of my schrö-dingdong will only be revealed if you wait ‘till bonding."
"Regardless, you have interrupted my calculations. Now you shall be headed," demanded the Red Queen.
"I shall be headed? Be the head of what?"
"Be the head of my next calculation. If you succeed, then you will be headed home."
"And If I say nay nay or I make doodoo on my calculations?"
"Then you shall be headed to my chemistry torture chamber. "
"Welp, I already know where I'm heading."

With a sleight of hand, the Red Queen writes out a question on a Windows Surface, which is projected onto a nearby screen.
It reads:
If in the process of formation, Amos produced 100 kJ of Gibbs free energy while absorbing 50J of enthalpy at a temperature of 27℃, what is his change in entropy? As well, is 
"O great cat o'Louie, I beseech thee" proclaimed Amos, while kneeling despairingly.
"If you're looking for trouble, here I am!" Louie appears in a buff of Amos gas.

	^G = ^H - T * ^S
 
	H = enthalpy, change in heat energy
	G = Gibbs free energy, energy available to do work
	S = entropy, randomness in the universe, measured in energy
	anytime one's working with energy, the unit is joules(J) or kilojoules(kJ)

"Now that you have the formula and how the variables work, all you need to do is plug in the numbers!"

Enter I if Amos messes up his calculations
Enter H if Amos completes his calculations
