Amos looked carefully, long and hard, at Louie's little formula.
"This is easy. I just need to plug stuff into the formula, but first I need to make some conversions," Amos said,

	27'C ->  273'K + 27'K = 300'K
	100kJ = 100,000J

Now I can plug the numbers all in. 

	^G = ^H - T * ^S
	> 100,000J = 50J - 300K * ^S
	> 300 * ^S = -99950J
	> ^S ~= -333.16J

The reaction is nonspontaneous because the change in free energy is positive, meaning the reaction gained energy and did not convert its reactants to products."
"Dammit it Amos! You got it right," barked Red Queen, "now you must head home to take a test!"
"But I don't wanna head home, needless to say do any tests."
Before Amos can say another word, he wakes up on an unfamiliar bed.
He turns over and Nikhon looks him in the eye, evidently creeped out.
"Why are you on Irani's bed?"
"Oh boy, I effed up," says Amos as he passes out again.
"Amos, faai di la, go to school," Amos wakes up again to his mom's voice.
But when he looks up, he sees Irani in his mom's apron.
Amos passes out one more time from shock. 
Amos wakes up once again with a blank piece of exam paper in front of him.
"5 minutes left!" Irani cried out.
Amos cried his eyes out.
