"I like Acids (& bases). They makes me feel good. Do you like acids?"

"Red Queen you're a masochist."

"I guess I'll just be a sadist and prove you wrong then," said the Red Queen as he prepares a vat of base.

"Amos, have you ever read ‘1001 Arabian Nights?'. Do you know what Aladdin did to those bandits?"

"...no?"

"He dunked them in a vat of hot oil and covered the lid. You'll suffer a worse fate though, since we're all out of hot oil."

"No please no!"

Disregarding Amos' pleas, Red Queen-sama dunks Amos into the basic vat.
"AHHhhh....? Wait I can't feel the burn."

"That must mean you're a metal. Metals don't react with bases. If that's the case, we'll soak you in acid. Once again, before I kill you I'll explain how this works.

There are two sets of definitions you need to know about acids and bases.

I'm sure you already knew acids and bases can be measured in pH, and less commonly, pOH. (use a scientific calculator to to solve the log functions)
pH = log [H3O+]
pOH = log [OH-]

But did you know water naturally ionizes into an acid and a base?
2H2O + 59 kJ => H3O+ + OH-
This could be proved by
[H3O+] x [OH-] = 1x10-14(Kw, constant for water)
pH + pOH = 14 

Acids could also be turned into a base(Brönsted-Lowry-wise), called a conjugate base, and vice-versa. Here's an example:
H2SO4(acid)+ H2O(base) => HSO4-(conjugate base) + H3O+(conjugate acid) 
Their strengths can also be ranked with Ka(for acids) and Kb(for bases) values, found by adding the acid/base to water.

HCl + H2O => Cl- + H3O+     Keq=[products] / [reactants] => Ka=[Cl-] [H3O+] / [HCl ] [H2O+] which we can simplify to Ka = [H3O+][Conj.Base] / [Conj.Acid ]

Ka can be used to calculate pH, and Kb can also be used to calculate pOH in the same way.
For example, if a reaction is Acid + H2O <-------> Conj. Base + H3O+
we know Ka = [H3O+][Conj.Base]/[Conj.Acid], we can find the pH, by isolating [H3O+] and logging it to find the pH value.

Kb works the same, just with [OH-] in place of [H3O+]
And last but not least, we have strong acids, which turn into 100% ions and thus corrode things better and weak acids…."  

Little does Amos know, the Red Queen has used a very dilute weak acid to corrode Amos' metal body, and that's why there isn't noticeably corrosion on him despite being submerged for so long. The Red Queen did this intentionally; he likes people to listen and acknowledge his intelligence. However, before that happened, Amos got tired of listening to all this bs and he committed suicide.
