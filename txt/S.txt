Louie, out of nowhere, pulls out a bucket of water and dumps it on Amos. 
"Why are you trying to dissolve me more?" cried Amos.

"You said you looked disgusting in this midway state right?"
Louie kept adding water until all the Amos dissolved in water.
"Maybe that wasn't the best choice," Louie said looking at the pool of liquid.
Louie decides to collect a sample of Amos(aq) to see if he can put him back together.
Through an unbelievably high-tech microscope Louie sees and recognizes some molecular structures in the Amos liquid. He pulls out his notes and finds out that most of the shapes are octahedron. 
In addition, Louie tries to figure out what types of intermolecular bonds (bonds between molecules)  are present in the Amos liquid, hoping this information would be helpful in putting him back together. 
 
As Louie examines the liquid closer, he sees a bunch of tiny Amos wobbling around. He realizes this is because of London Dispersion, the attraction between adjacent molecules when electrons move to positions that form a temporary dipole.

Louie then notices that some Amos' head are stuck to other's feet. Upon studying his booklet, Louie figures out that this is resulted from dipole-dipole force, which is the attraction between a negative end of a dipole and another's positive end.
He also detects that even more Amos are also stuck to H2O molecules. Louie determines that this is because of Hydrogen Bonds, which is a special type of dipole-dipole bond that is strong because of the lack shielding around H. This only works when H is bonded to a highly electronegative atom such as N, O, or F.

After hours of research, Louie comes to a conclusion that he is incapable of reconstructing Amos. Louie stops caring and moves on with his cat life.
