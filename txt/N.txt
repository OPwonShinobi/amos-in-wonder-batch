After walking with Alex the Guard for two days, the guard leads Amos to a giant gate that opens into a fabulous castle. Amos is escorted to a grand hallway. At the end, there is a throne room, equipped with a trap queen dressed in red.

"Who is this?"
"Your trap majesty, I've trapped this suspicious thing wandering in the garden. I think he might be a spy. We should take precautionary..."
"God I hate things, you can shut your trap. Trap him in the trapping room. We can use him as a hybridization test subject."
"Why do you keep on repeating the word ‘trap' ? Is it because you are one?" Amos inquired innocently.
"SILENCE! We shall have you interrogated thoroughly." the Trap Queen was mad, trapped, and he felt slapped for his use of the word ‘trap'.

Enter O if Amos gives honest answers
Enter P if Amos lies
