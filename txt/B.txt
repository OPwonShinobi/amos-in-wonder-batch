Amos points to the pill. Upon closer inspection the red tablet reads "MADE IN CHINA." Louie gives him both the pill and the glass of blue liquid to down it. Amos starts to foam at the mouth.
Amos finds himself in a meadow. He notices a rabbit wearing a waistcoat looking at a pocket watch. 

"Look at the time, it's tea time."
Amos, bewildered, follows the rabbit into a nearby rabbit hole, and falls in.
He falls for a long time, and lands on the rabbit, killing it.

Standing up, Amos finds himself standing with his back against a brick wall. He notices that for every x unit of time, he shrinks by half, in brick units. Finding that he is actually shrinking at a set rate. Out of the blue, a floating cat appears with Louie's visage. He presents amos with a set of formulas teaching him about the rate that he is decreasing in. Usually, concentration is measured in molarity (moles / litres), but this case, assume concentration = Amos' height. From the formula  " Rate = k[Amos]n ", Amos looks for his n value. By finding this n, the order of the reaction, Amos can link it to one of three given half life formulas. This way, he can find the amount of Amos(s) remaining after x time.

Reaction formula:
Amos(small) + Unknown(l/aq) + Pill(s) ->  Amos (smaller)

     Amos' Height        |
(cm, aka concentration)  | Rate of Formation (concentration/s)
--------------------------------------------------------------
150                      | 15
75                       | 7.5
37.5                     | 3.75
18.75                    | 1.875

Since the formula is k[Amos]n , then 
           n                                                                         n
15 = k[150]  <= writing it like this cancels out the k, and Amos is left with 2 = [2] , thus n = 1, 
____________    meaning the reaction is first order
           n
7.5 = k[75] 	    


After finally figuring out the algebra, Amos looks around and finds an old, dusty apartment. He enters and finds a table decorated with a glass of water and a cake.
       
Enter C if Amos drinks the water
Enter E if Amos eats the cake, proceed to E
